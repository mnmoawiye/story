        As you come of age, your heart beats with ambition, but your future is uncertain. The empire that controls the magic of the arcane or the power of technology will shape the world. 

        You must choose your path: Will you embrace the arcane arts and wield magic as a Mage, bending reality to your will? Or will you pursue knowledge and innovation as an Engineer, using science to forge powerful weapons and machines that could turn the tide of war?

        The choice is yours, but remember, each decision comes with its own destiny. Your actions will have consequences. What will you become in this world of magic and machines?`,
